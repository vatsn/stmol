A component for building interactive molecular visualizations within Streamlit web-applications. It is designed to provide a state of the art visualizing and rendering 3D molecular structures for researchers, in a user-friendly manner.

------------------------------

## Stmol features 

- An easy-to-use component for rendering interactive 3D molecular visualizations of protein and ligand structures within Streamlit web-apps
- `stmol` can render protein and ligand structures with just a few lines of Python code by utilizing popular visualization libraries, currently Py3DMol and Speck. 
- On the user-end, `stmol` does not require expertise to interactively navigate. 
- On the developer-end, `stmol` can be easily integrated within structural bioinformatic and cheminformatic pipelines to provide a simple means for user-end researchers to advance biological studies and drug discovery efforts.
